## [v0.2.4] - 2026-06-29

### ✨ Added

* Added a complete retrieval evaluation framework.
* Implemented `Precision@K` for measuring retrieval accuracy.
* Implemented `Recall@K` for measuring retrieval coverage.
* Implemented `Reciprocal Rank` for ranking quality evaluation.
* Added `Evaluator` for evaluating individual retrieval queries.
* Added `Benchmark` for running evaluation suites over multiple queries.
* Introduced `BaseRetriever` abstract interface to standardize retrieval implementations.
* Added `BenchmarkResult` and evaluation data models.

### 🧪 Testing

* Added smoke tests for the complete benchmarking pipeline.
* Verified end-to-end integration of retrieval, evaluation, and benchmarking components.

### 🛠️ Improvements

* Refactored retrieval architecture to use a common retriever interface.
* Improved recall calculation by counting unique retrieved documents.
* Added comprehensive documentation, comments, and type hints across the evaluation module.

## v0.2.3

### ✨ Added

- Introduced `BaseOCR` abstraction.
- Added `RapidOCRProcessor` implementation.
- Integrated OCR fallback into the PDF ingestion pipeline.
- Added support for extracting text from scanned PDFs.

### 🏗️ Improvements

- OCR is now decoupled from document ingestion through dependency inversion.
- Native PDF text extraction remains the primary path, with OCR used only when needed.
- Improved resource management using context managers for PDF handling.

### 🧪 Testing

- Verified OCR extraction on a 614-page scanned edition of the Brahma Sutras (1936).

- BaseReranker abstraction
- Integration of reranking into HybridRetriever

### 🧪 Testing

- Added end-to-end reranking smoke test

### 🏗️ Improvements

- Retrieval pipeline now supports optional reranking
- Improved modular retrieval architecture

- ChapterChunker for chapter-aware document chunking

### 🧪 Testing

- Added smoke tests for RecursiveChunker
- Added smoke tests for ChapterChunker

### 🏗️ Improvements
